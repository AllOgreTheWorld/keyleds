This project supports all Logitech RGB leds USB keyboards, on all keyboard layouts.

Features
--------

* Flexible per-application RGB settings with `key groups`_.
* Reacts to window title changes, enabling switching profiles based on
  current webpage in browser or open file extension in editors.
* Improved, fully configurable animation plugins:

  - **Keypress feedback** effect.
  - **Fixed** colors.
  - **Breathing** effect.
  - **Wave** effect.
  - **Stars** effect.
  - **Idle dimming** effect.

* **Create your own effects** with the `LUA engine`_.
* Several plugins can be active at once, and composited with **alpha blending** to
  build complex effects.

* Plays nicely with systemd sessions, detecting user switches so multiple users can
  use the service without them fighting over keyboard control.
* Supports multipe keyboards with different configuration per keyboard.

And a few goodies:

* **DBUS Interface** for scripting and richer interactions with your LUA effects.
* **Command-line tool** for your scripting needs and extended configuration
  (set game-mode keys, change report rate, see USB exchangesâ€¦).
