# Profiles trigger plugin activation when their lookup matches
# Their name doesn't matter, but order does, as plugins are always rendered
# in the order they appear here, so plugins that come after can overwrite
# led states set buy those that came before.
#
# Any number of profiles can be active at any time. A profile with no lookup
# or default setting is always active. Lookups use regular expression. They
# must match fully (as if they were automatically enclosed in ^$).
#
# Anytime a color is specified, it can be either:
#   - a 6-digit RGB hexadecimal color, web-style. Eg: ffff00 is yellow.
#   - an 8-digit RGBA hexadecimal color. Last two digits specify transparency,
#     from 00 (transparent) to ff (opaque).
#   - a color name, from CSS web color names. Those are always fully opaque.
#
# Note that there is no buffer clear in between renders. So to avoid odd
# flickering, every key should be written to by at least one plugin.
# If that is an issue, simply start with the fill plugin, setting all keys
# to opaque black or some other color.
