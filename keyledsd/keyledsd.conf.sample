# Effects define a named set of plugins for use in profiles.
# Effects are rendered in order, so effects down the list can see and/or
# overwrite whatever was rendered by effects higher in the list.
#
# Anytime a color is specified, it can be either:
#   - a 6-digit RGB hexadecimal color, web-style. Eg: ffff00 is yellow.
#   - an 8-digit RGBA hexadecimal color. Last two digits specify transparency,
#     from 00 (transparent) to ff (opaque).
#   - a color name, from CSS web color names. Those are always fully opaque.
#
# Note that there is no buffer clear in between renders. So to avoid odd
# flickering, every key should be written to by at least one plugin.
# If that is an issue, simply start with the fill plugin, setting all keys
# to opaque black or some other color.
