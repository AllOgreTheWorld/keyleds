Files in this directory describe the physical layout of keyboards.
Names follow format <model>_<layout>.yaml
    model: model code from device, 6 bytes written in hexadecimal. For USB devices,
           this is the product id on 16 bits followed by 4 0-bytes.
    layout: layout code from device, 2 bytes written in hexadecimal.

Source file format is XML, with the following structure:
    root element (any tag)
        attributes:
            - (str)layout: gives name of layout
        elements:
            <keyboard> describe a block of keys

    <keyboard> element (under root element)
        attributes:
            - (uint)zone: the block id of the keys appearing under this keyboard node
            - (uint)x, (uint)y: the position of the block's top left corner
            - (uint)width, (uint)height: the dimensions of the block
        elements:
            <row> wrap a row of keys in the block

    <row> element (under keyboard element)
            Describe a row of keys. Row height is the height of keyboard divided by
            number of rows. Row width is equal to that of the keyboard.
        no attributes
        elements:
            <key> describe a single key or lack thereof

    <key> element (under row element)
            Describe a single slot in a row. It may either be a key (if it has
            a code attribute) or a hole. Key height is equal to that of the row.
            Key width is equal to that of the row divided amongst all slots,
            weighted by their width multiplier.
        attributes:
            - (uint)code: key scancode as emitted by keyboard. <key> elements without a
                            code attribute describe a hole in the layout.
            - (str)glyph: key name. Mostly useful for keys that have no keycode at OS
                            level, such as FN key or GameMode key.
            - (float)width: width multiplier for this key. Defaults to 1.
        no elements
