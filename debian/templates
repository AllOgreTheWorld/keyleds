Default: true
Description: Install udev rules to allow plugdev access
 By default, Logitech devices are only usable by root. This means
 you will need to run keyledsctl as root.
 If you say Yes to this option, new udev rules will be installed to
 make Logitech devices usable by all members of the "plugdev" group,
 avoiding the need to run keyledsctl as root.
